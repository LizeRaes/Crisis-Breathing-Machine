# Crisis-Breathing-Machine
Specs and design for a crisis breathing machine for mass production to bring down Covid19 victims
It's urgent. Why? see at the end of the page

Currently needed:
1. Specifications
Welcome in this section: 
- summaries of technical specifications you can find
- schemes with as much details as possible
- information from medical professionals on specifications of a breathing machine in the specific case of Corona (please ask around and mention your sources)

We need to know:
- what pressure, flow rate and frequency
- is extra oxygen necessary in case of Covid19? (complicates deployment at home)
- if tubing into the trachea is vital or if a mask is sufficient
- if there is a way to feed patients at home (intravenous/esophagus)
- any other medical information on how to best perform this, and which expertise is required
- what complications can arise (infections due to materials used, ...)

2. Propositions
General parts:
- pump
- pump controll
- oxygenation if required
- air heating and moisturing
- piping
- attachment/intubation system
- feeding

Please add ideas for the full design, or design of parts. Keep in mind
- we need it fast (1 or 2 weeks)
- we need to use supplies that are commonly and abundantly available
- assembly must be possible in a short time
- micro-processors must be producible in short time and big quantities (order of 10.000)
- same goes for pumps (3D-printing?)
- money will probably not be an issue, given the importance of the matter
- you probably can count on hands that will want to help with assembling, people will be willing to help

3. Raise awareness
Let's try to get this project 'institutionalized'.
Ask fellow engineers/mechanics/medics to join.
Mention the project to people 'in charge' (politicians, hospital staff, university leaders)

4. Funding
e.g.
- crowdfunding campaign
- ask government aid
- donations

5. Permission
Ideally we will need permission of the ethical commission for medical devices. If you have contacts there, please ask what is necessary and how fast it an go in crisis times.

6. Organisation
Who wants to take the lead?


Why?
Italy is currently (14th of March) unable to help 3 out of 4 critical Covid19 patients due to lack of breathing machines. Older people with less survival chances are just left at home to die. Other European countries (Belgium, Netherlands, France, Switzerland) are heading there quickly, in 2 weeks we are in exactly that situation. Lacking breathing machines results in this disease having a mortality rate of 4% instead of 0.5%. Having enough breathing machines available can save tens of thousands of lives, in France alone.
